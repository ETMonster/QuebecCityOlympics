                                Québec City, the capital city of La Belle Province is located in the heart of Québec on the north shore of the St. Lawrence river where it 
                                intersects with the River Saint Charles. Québec City is positioned in the St. Lawrence Lowlands region which is where more than 25% of Québec’s population 
                                is situated. In 1759, the Battle of Québec was fought during the Seven Years War in The Plains of Abraham. Today, the Plains of Abraham are a known landmark
                                and memorial in Québec City. Due to Québec City’s placement on the St. Lawrence River, most of the surrounding area is flat and low-lying. However, 
                                numerous snowy mountains populate the area around Québec City making the city the most reliable for mountain-related sports since there are multiple 
                                alternate choices.

                                and the New France festival,  where citizens celebrate the history of Québec and its capital city. French folklore and legends were brought over to Canada 
                                when France colonized what was then Québec. Québec City is very engraved in the winter sports scene having large backgrounds in hockey and skiing.

                                climate region, has a significant annual variation of temperatures and has four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Since spring occurs later in the
